Let users add what they need as a gift list regardless of occasion (xmas, birthday etc.).
List can be shared with friends, which also have a gift list.
The list is visible only with the friends the user shared it to.
Anyone who can see the list can pick an item from the list. Once picked, the item will not be available for others to avoid gift duplication.
The one to receive the gift, will not know what items have been picked and will make sure to remove the gifts once he/she got them and add others.
